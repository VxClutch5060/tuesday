    <p>In this game, each player begins with a set amount of mana, which is 25. To gain additional mana, players can defeat enemy monsters. The objective of the game is to outlast your opponent by reducing their mana to zero.

      To help you achieve this goal, you can summon monsters by spending your accumulated mana. These monsters can help you defend against attacks, attack your opponent, or perform other actions to gain an advantage.
      
      In addition to summoning monsters, you can also use abilities to help you in battle. These abilities require mana to use, just like summoning monsters. Depending on the ability, you may be able to heal your own monsters, damage your opponent's monsters, or perform other strategic actions to help you gain the upper hand.
      
      Overall, the game requires a combination of strategic thinking, resource management, and tactical decision-making to succeed. By using your mana wisely and summoning the right monsters at the right time, you can defeat your opponent and emerge victorious!</p>
